This project presents a comprehensive analysis of multi-country retail sales data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to generate actionable business insights related to revenue, profitability, product performance, and sales efficiency. The dataset consolidates transactional sales records from six countries: Canada, China, India, Nigeria, United Kingdom, and United States. By integrating these regional datasets into a single structured database, the project enables cross-country comparison and global sales performance evaluation.

The process began with data consolidation using SQL, where six individual country tables were merged into one unified dataset. Data cleaning techniques were applied to handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, validate transaction records, and eliminate duplicates. Key financial metrics such as Total Amount and Profit were engineered directly within SQL to enhance analytical depth. Excel was used for preliminary validation, formatting checks, and quick exploratory analysis before visualization.

Advanced SQL queries were developed to answer critical business questions, including identifying top-performing countries, best-selling products, highest-performing sales representatives, and the most profitable store locations within a selected date range. Aggregation functions were used to calculate minimum, maximum, average, and total sales and profit values, allowing for a clear understanding of revenue distribution and financial performance trends.

The cleaned and transformed dataset was then imported into Power BI, where an interactive dashboard was designed. The dashboard includes KPI cards, bar charts, ranking visuals, and slicers for dynamic date filtering. These visual elements provide stakeholders with real-time insights into revenue patterns, profitability trends, and sales contribution by region, product category, and employee performance.

Overall, this project demonstrates strong data analytics capabilities, combining database management, business intelligence, and data visualization to transform raw transactional data into meaningful strategic insights that support data-driven decision-making.
